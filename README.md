## Sophos Outbound Web Proxy on the AWS Cloud


This Quick Start automatically deploys an outbound web filtering proxy on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud, using the Sophos Unified Threat Management (UTM) virtual appliance. The Quick Start also uses Sophos Outbound Gateway to extend security to multiple virtual private clouds (VPCs).

Sophos UTM provides multiple security functions, including firewall, intrusion prevention (IPS), VPN, and web filtering. Sophos Outbound Gateway provides a distributed, fault-tolerant architecture to provide visibility, policy enforcement, and elastic scalability to outbound web traffic. 

The Quick Start builds a cloud environment that enables you to whitelist AWS API calls without allowing internet access. You can also use this reference deployment to enable other proxy use cases with Sophos UTM.
